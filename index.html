     <h1>The Learn Enough Story</h1>
     <p>
       Learn enough to be dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach
       technical sophistication, the seemingly magical abiliy to take
       command of your commputer and get it to do your bidding. This includes
       everything from command lines and coding to guessig keyboard shortcuts,

       Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.
       We believe that there are a billion people that can benefit from learning
       technical sophistication, probably more. To join our movement
